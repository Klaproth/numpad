# numpad
Blind number pad change experiment to test representational change

## Procedure
A python experimental task using either a phone or calculator number pad design. Depending on the experimental condition, the task starts with a test trial by asking the user to type in a given code with one of the numpads using the mouse. For each number button the user clicks, a '\*' appears on top of the number pad labeled "Your Code:". When the user entry reaches the lenght of the code to be entered, the test trial ends. Before the first experimental trial starts, the number arrangement changes to the other numpad design (phone to calc or calc to phone, resp.) while the numbers on the buttons are hidden (see illustrations). Again the user is asked to enter a code by using the mouse.

phone to calc   
1 2 3      _ _ _     
4 5 6  ->  _ _ _
7 8 9      _ _ _ 
  0        _
phone to calc
7 8 9      _ _ _
4 5 6  ->  _ _ _
1 2 3      _ _ _ 
0            _
#### Changing number pads

If the user changes his/her mental representation and enters the code correctly, a positive feedback is given and the task is finished. In case of an incorrect response, the feedback depends on the experimental conditions and the experimental task continues with the next trial. In some conditions, a visual cue (called "Framebreaker") is given after a predefined number of trials. After displaying the cue, the final trial starts. In conditions where no framebreaker is shown, the task ends after 10 trials. A description of the experimental condition is given below.

(x) = Framebreaker Feedback
1 = phone -> calc, calc(x), calc
2 = phone -> calc, calc, calc, calc, calc(x), calc
3 = phone -> calc, calc, calc, calc, calc, calc, calc, calc, calc, calc
4 = phone -> phone, phone, phone, phone, phone, phone, phone, phone, phone, phone
5 = calc -> phone, phone(x), phone# 6 = calc -> phone, phone, phone, phone, phone(x), phone
7 = calc -> phone, phone, phone, phone, phone, phone, phone, phone, phone, phone
8 = calc -> calc, calc, calc, calc, calc, calc, calc, calc, calc, calc
